main file contains all the function calls in order
subsequent files contain the function definitions(making it modular)
and then a function(file) for parsing the html and returning it in a readable format(maybe just the parsing logic that other functions utilize)



add a py installer for a gui launcher for linux/maybe windows later?
install from terminal?
